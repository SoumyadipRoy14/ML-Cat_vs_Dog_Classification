_**Dogs vs Cats Classification**_

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either dogs or cats. The dataset used is the "Dogs vs Cats" dataset from Kaggle.

**Project Workflow**
1. Download and Extract the Dataset
Dataset Source: The "Dogs vs Cats" dataset is downloaded directly from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
Extraction: The downloaded dataset is in a zip format, which is extracted to obtain the image files.
2. Data Preparation
Directory Structure: The dataset is organized into training and validation directories.
Image Loading: Images are loaded and converted into a format suitable for model training using TensorFlow's image_dataset_from_directory method.
3. Data Preprocessing
Normalization: The pixel values of the images are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to facilitate better model performance.
Batch Processing: Images are processed in batches to optimize memory usage and training efficiency.
4. Building the CNN Model
Model Architecture: The CNN model is constructed using several layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for down-sampling, and dense layers for classification.
Activation Functions: ReLU activation is used in convolutional layers to introduce non-linearity, and a sigmoid activation function is used in the output layer for binary classification.
5. Compiling the Model
Optimizer: The Adam optimizer is used for model training due to its efficiency and ability to handle sparse gradients.
Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy is chosen as the loss function since the task is a binary classification problem.
Metrics: Accuracy is used as the primary metric to evaluate the model's performance.
6. Training the Model
Epochs: The model is trained over multiple epochs, with each epoch involving a complete pass through the training dataset.
Validation: Validation data is used to monitor the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.
7. Evaluating the Model
Accuracy and Loss: Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the model's learning progress and identify any signs of overfitting or underfitting.
8. Making Predictions
Image Classification: A function is defined to preprocess and classify new images using the trained model. The function resizes the input image, makes predictions, and prints whether the image is of a dog or a cat.

**Results Visualization**
Plots: Graphs of training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to assess the model's performance over time.

**Tools and Libraries**
TensorFlow and Keras: Used for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
OpenCV: Used for image processing tasks like resizing.
Matplotlib: Used for plotting the accuracy and loss graphs.
Kaggle API: Used for downloading the dataset directly from Kaggle.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for training a CNN to classify images of dogs and cats. It covers dataset handling, model building, training, evaluation, and making predictions on new data.
